# global-covid-19-vaccine-apartheid
This <a href='https://kwstancil.github.io/global-covid-19-vaccine-apartheid' target="blank"> map</a> depicts unequal access to Covid-19 vaccines around the world. It also highlights whether
governments support or oppose an initiative to suspend certain intellectual property restrictions
for the duration of the pandemic to boost the production of jabs, tests, and treatments.
Big Pharma has tried to defend its extremely profitable IP monopolies by claiming that waiving
patents won't lead to an increase in the global supply of lifesaving medical tools because generic
drug manufacturers in the Global South lack the capacity to replicate the mRNA manufacturing
process, but that talking point has been debunked numerous times. New data, represented in this
map, show that 120 firms in Africa, Asia, and Latin America stand ready to make billions of doses
of Covid-19 vaccines if Pfizer, Moderna, and other pharmaceutical corporations were compelled to
share recipes and technology, which wouldn't exist in the first place without billions of dollars
in public support, including years of taxpayer-funded research.
